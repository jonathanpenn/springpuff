# Spring Puff

A fun iOS application written in RubyMotion that demonstrates fast animations
with display links, real time audio processing, CocoaPods, and referencing
Objective C code.

## Installation

You'll need to install [RubyMotion](http://rubymotion.com) first. Then install CocoaPods by running this from the command line:

    sudo gem install cocoapods

You don't need to run this as `sudo` if you are using your favorite Ruby version manager.

Now, run `rake` to execute and build for the iPhone Simulator.

Enjoy!
